📝AI Course Project

🌟Search Algorithms for Route Navigation🌟

The aim of this project is to implement a graph that contain nodes represent the cities in Palestine. And then finding the optimal path from the source city to destination city using several searching algorithms such as A*, Depth First Search(DFS), Breadth First Search(BFS), greedy, and any other searching algorithms implemented by any programming language. According to our ID student’s numbers, our duty is to implement the BFS, DFS, and A* searching algorithms, and testing them to find the path from one city to another city in Palestine
